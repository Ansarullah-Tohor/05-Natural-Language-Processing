German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who led the party until stepping aside earlier this year to make way for former European Parliament president Martin Schulz, said he supported Macron s call for a separate budget for the eurozone.  We should be ready to invest more in our future,  Gabriel told Germany s Funke newspaper group and the French newspaper Ouest-France in an interview published Saturday. Germany is the biggest winner of the EU and can afford to contribute more.   Gabriel said Macron s proposals to reform the European Union would be  very important  in the coalition talks, which are due to begin on Jan. 7 after Merkel failed to reach agreement with two smaller parties. He said he was enthusiastic about Macron s core idea of strengthening the EU and making it a global player. The SPD had initially hoped to go into opposition after suffering its worst election losses in the post-war era, but was persuaded to enter into negotiations with conservatives to avoid new elections. Merkel earlier this month gave her strongest endorsement of Macron s proposals, but Germany has been hamstrung in taking more decisive action on any concrete proposals until it has a new government in place. Merkel said she saw promising areas of common ground with Social Democrats on the future of Europe, and urged speedy action to work on EU reforms before the next European elections in 2019. This week she said she wants an initial coalition deal with the SPD by mid-January. Macron hopes to make progress with Germany on ideas to reform the eurozone by March, once Germany has a new coalition government in place, with the goal of agreeing a  roadmap  with all eurozone leaders by June. Gabriel also called for the EU to adopt programs that would encourage communities in poorer member states to accept more migrants by offering financial assistance.     \",\n          \"Donald Trump likes feuds. He cannot, for any reason, take criticism, so the second someone says something less than a million percent complimentary about him, Trump has to lash out. His latest target is a union leader for Carrier, the company that Trump has been boasting about all over the place because he supposedly saved bunches of jobs. However, Trump inflated the numbers, and, worst of all, left out the problematic nature of the deal, which included $7 million in tax cuts for the company in exchange for keeping the jobs in the United States.Chuck Jones, the leader of the union for the workers at that Indiana plant, said that Trump, quote,  lied his ass off, about the deal, including the number of jobs saved. Well, this led Trump to attack Jones via Twitter, and voila! A new Trump feud is born. Now, as if it weren t bad enough that Trump himself is acting like a spoiled child rather than the president-elect, Republican National Committee spokesman Sean Spicer is also joining in the dog piling on Jones. On Thursday, Spicer went on Fox News and said the following of Jones: He should be grateful for Mr. Trump and [Republican Indiana] Gov. [Mike] Pence s efforts to save those jobs. Here you have a guy that talked about Carrier and the importance of keeping jobs. He picks up the phone and closes a deal. You ve got a 1,000 people that are going to have a blessed holiday season that are not worried about jobs. They get to spend this time with family and friends knowing that they have a job with good benefits. That s something that should be celebrated. No, Trump s lies should not be celebrated, Mr. Spicer. Were SOME jobs saved? Sure. But the method by which they were saved is not a sustainable one, and it is costing Indiana taxpayers   you know, the folks Trump keeps promising to help   millions. Further, it s not Chuck Jones who lied. It s Donald Trump. Splicer insisted that it was Jones lying about Trump, though: And then you ve got a union boss that goes out and fabricates how the story went down for no reason. I think Mr. Trump is never going to sit back and let someone take a shot falsely at him without responding. This is the problem with Trump cronies and mouthpieces. They swallow every outrage, every lie, as if none of it matters. They refuse to see the very grave shortcomings of their Cheeto Jesus, and they fall in lockstep no matter how insane his behavior becomes.Look forward to four years of not just Trump acting like a whiny, narcissistic baby, but, apparently, he ll have the might of the entire GOP behind him doing the same.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images\",\n          \"The police in Brazil said on Saturday that they had made the first arrest in the search for more than 30 possible attackers in the gang rape of a    girl, a case that has prompted widespread outrage and vows by the federal government to combat crimes against women, news agencies reported. Brazilians reacted with shock after the May 21 assault came to light last week. Graphic photos and videos of the unconscious, naked teenager were posted on Twitter, and several men joked online about the attack. The authorities said the teenager had been raped in the S\\u00e3o Jo\\u00e3o shantytown on the west side of Rio de Janeiro as she was visiting her boyfriend, The Associated Press reported. The girl told the police that she was briefly alone with him but remembered nothing until she woke up naked the next day in another building among dozens of men who had guns. The first arrest came after the military police fanned out in search of four suspects who had been identified, the news organization Agence   reported. The police said they did not know if the boyfriend was one of the attackers, though he was being sought. The case has rocked Brazil, Latin America\\u2019s largest nation, and highlighted its   problem of violence against women. President Michel Temer promised to create a federal police unit to address crimes against women, The Associated Press reported. \\u201cIt\\u2019s absurd that in the 21st century we have to live with barbarous crimes like this,\\u201d said Mr. Temer, who also called an emergency meeting of the security ministers for each of Brazil\\u2019s states to consider   crimes. Demonstrators gathered in downtown Rio on Friday night with signs that said \\u201cMachismo kills\\u201d and \\u201cNo means no,\\u201d Agence   reported. In S\\u00e3o Paulo, protesters made a mural with messages that included \\u201cI like to wear necklines, that\\u2019s not an invitation to rape me. \\u201d The girl, in brief comments to the O Globo newspaper, said: \\u201cIt\\u2019s the stigma that hurts me the most. It is as if people are saying: \\u2018It\\u2019s her fault. She was using scanty clothes.\\u2019 I want people to know that it is not the woman\\u2019s fault. You can\\u2019t blame a robbery victim for being robbed. \\u201d At a news conference on Friday, the police said the girl had reported being raped by 33 men officials said they had been unable to confirm how many men might have taken part. Rio\\u2019s police chief, Fernando Veloso, said that if images had not been posted online, the authorities might not have learned of the attack. The Brazilian Center for Latin American Studies found that more than 92, 000 women were killed in   crimes, including rape and domestic abuse, from 1980 to 2010.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    },\n    {\n      \"column\": \"label\",\n      \"properties\": {\n        \"dtype\": \"category\",\n        \"num_unique_values\": 4,\n        \"samples\": [\n          \"0\",\n          \" \\u0437\\u0430 \\u0443\\u0447\\u0430\\u0441\\u0442\\u0438\\u0435. \\u0411\\u043b\\u0430\\u0433\\u043e\\u0434\\u0430\\u0440\\u044e \\u0432\\u0430\\u0441.\",\n          \"1\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \\u201cWe conclude that CBO\\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \\u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\\u2019s tax credits, saying, \\u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \\u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \\u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\\u2019s advanceable, so it\\u2019s available today. \\u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \\u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \\u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \\u201d\",\n          \"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \\u201cplanned on skipping\\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \\u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\\u201d later in the afternoon. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\\u201d Blount said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \\u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \\u201cBeen there, done that,\\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \\u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \\u201cBasic reason for me is I don\\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\\u2019t. \\u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \\u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \\u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \\u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\\u2019t make the trip this year.\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO  \\u2014   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \\u201cthe world\\u2019s dominant supplier\\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \\u201celevated royalties\\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. \\u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. \\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \\u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\\u2019s tough. \\u201d Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm\\u2019s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm\\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm\\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm\\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. \\u201cYou\\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\\u201d said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \\u201cWe enabled those markets. \\u201d South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\\u2019s revenue. Apple\\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  \\u2014   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today\\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. \\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \\u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests. \\u201d In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \\u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm\\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\\u2019s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\\u2019s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\\u2019ve contributed to their success,\\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\\u2019s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not sitting still\\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \\u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. \\u201d In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\\u2019s expensive intellectual property.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \\u201cWe conclude that CBO\\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \\u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\\u2019s tax credits, saying, \\u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \\u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \\u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\\u2019s advanceable, so it\\u2019s available today. \\u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \\u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \\u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \\u201d\",\n          \"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \\u201cplanned on skipping\\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \\u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\\u201d later in the afternoon. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\\u201d Blount said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \\u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \\u201cBeen there, done that,\\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \\u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \\u201cBasic reason for me is I don\\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\\u2019t. \\u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \\u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \\u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \\u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\\u2019t make the trip this year.\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO  \\u2014   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \\u201cthe world\\u2019s dominant supplier\\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \\u201celevated royalties\\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. \\u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. \\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \\u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\\u2019s tough. \\u201d Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm\\u2019s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm\\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm\\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm\\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. \\u201cYou\\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\\u201d said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \\u201cWe enabled those markets. \\u201d South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\\u2019s revenue. Apple\\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  \\u2014   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today\\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. \\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \\u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests. \\u201d In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \\u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm\\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\\u2019s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\\u2019s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\\u2019ve contributed to their success,\\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\\u2019s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not sitting still\\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \\u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. \\u201d In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\\u2019s expensive intellectual property.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",

[The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) has yet to score the Ryan plan, although the Brookings Institution\\u2019s report does not bode well for the House leadership\\u2019s bill.  The Ryan plan reports, \\u201cWe conclude that CBO\\u2019s analysis will likely estimate that at least 15 million people will lose coverage under the American Health Care Act (AHCA) by the end of the   scoring window. Estimates could be higher, but it\\u2019s [sic] is unlikely they will be significantly lower. \\u201d The Kaiser Family Foundation states that the Ryan plan\\u2019s tax credits aid wealthier Americans more than   individuals. Older Americans would face comparatively less aid through tax credits than younger counterparts. American Medical Association CEO James Madara also criticized the Republican leadership\\u2019s tax credits, saying, \\u201cWe believe credits inversely related to income, rather than age as proposed in the committee\\u2019s legislation, not only result in greater numbers of people insured but are a more efficient use of   resources. \\u201d Ways and Means Chairman Kevin Brady ( ) has maintained that tax credits help everyone get covered. He said, \\u201cIt covers more people, because it applies to those who don\\u2019t have a tax liability, and it\\u2019s advanceable, so it\\u2019s available today. \\u201d Avik Roy, a health expert at Forbes, argued that tax credits in the Ryan plan will \\u201cprice many poor and vulnerable people out of the health insurance market. \\u201d Michael Cannon, the Cato Institute\\u2019s director of health policy studies, believes that the GOP\\u2019s Obamacare replacement bill will force the poor to lose their coverage. He lamented, \\u201cIf the tax credits (read: subsidies) for   Americans are less than under Obamacare, many more   patients will lose coverage. Premiums will continue to rise. Republicans will take the blame for all of it, because they will have failed to repeal Obamacare, or learn its lessons, when they had the chance. \\u201d\",\n          \"At least six members of the Super   New England Patriots have said they will not visit the White House for the traditional meeting that championship teams have with the president. Running back LeGarrette Blount, defensive end Chris Long and defensive tackle Alan Branch on Thursday became the latest to announce that they would skip the visit. Long posted on Twitter that he \\u201cplanned on skipping\\u201d in response to a column in The Daily News that urged him to skip. Blount revealed his decision on Fox Sports in a radio interview on \\u201cThe Rich Eisen Show\\u201d later in the afternoon. \\u201cI just don\\u2019t feel welcome in that house,\\u201d Blount said. \\u201cI\\u2019m going to just leave it at that. \\u201d Branch told Sirius XM Radio that he planned to spend time with family. A day earlier, the Pro Bowl linebacker Dont\\u2019a Hightower bowed out when he told ESPN, \\u201cBeen there, done that,\\u201d having visited with a championship Alabama team. Tight end Martellus Bennett told reporters after the Super Bowl that he would not go: \\u201cIt is what it is,\\u201d he said. \\u201cPeople know how I feel about it. Just follow me on Twitter. \\u201d The outspoken Bennett had joked that he might move to outer space after Donald J. Trump was elected. The Pro Bowl safety Devin McCourty, a team captain,  told Time magazine: \\u201cBasic reason for me is I don\\u2019t feel accepted in the White House. With the president having so many strong opinions and prejudices, I believe certain people might feel accepted there while others won\\u2019t. \\u201d Bennett and McCourty were in the news for their activism last fall, when they raised their fists in protest during the national anthem for one game. At the time, athletes in various sports were protesting racial oppression in the country. The number of Patriots absences may well increase. Running back James White said he had not made up his mind whether to go. \\u201cI\\u2019ll wait till the time comes and decide then,\\u201d he said. No date has been scheduled for this year\\u2019s ceremony honoring the Patriots. The ceremony for last year\\u2019s champions, the Broncos, took place in June. Perhaps no other team has as close an association with Trump as the Patriots. Just before the election, Trump claimed that he had the support of Patriots quarterback Tom Brady and Coach Bill Belichick. Brady, who displayed a \\u201cMake America Great Again\\u201d cap in his locker during the campaign, never explicitly endorsed Trump, but he spoke favorably of him and they have socialized. Trump also cited a supportive letter he had received from Belichick, and several news media accounts confirmed the letter was authentic. The team\\u2019s owner, Robert K. Kraft, has said he has considered Trump a longtime friend. Brady did not attend his team\\u2019s visit with former President Barack Obama at the White House, in 2015, citing family issues. But some athletes who have skipped the trip over the years have explicitly given politics as a reason. Bruins goalie Tim Thomas declined to visit the Obama White House with his teammates in January 2012, saying in a statement: \\u201cI believe the federal government has grown out of control, threatening the rights, liberties and property of the people. \\u201cBecause I believe this, today I exercised my right as a free citizen, and did not visit the White House. \\u201d Baltimore Ravens center Matt Birk cited his opposition to abortion as the reason for skipping a 2013 visit. A number of other athletes have skipped the ceremony while citing scheduling conflicts or family commitments. Presidents for years have invited sports figures to the White House, but the tradition of honoring championships teams there solidified under Ronald Reagan. Major professional champions and many college champions stop by for a presentation and a photo opportunity. Six Patriots, so far, won\\u2019t make the trip this year.\",\n          \"SAN FRANCISCO  \\u2014   By mastering some tough computer chip technology and then pulling off an audacious business strategy based on selling its smartphone knowledge, Qualcomm has made billions of dollars and seized influence in the tech industry. Some days that is a real drag. On Friday, Apple, its longtime partner, sued Qualcomm over what it said was $1 billion in withheld rebates. In the lawsuit, filed in Federal District Court for the Southern District of California, in San Diego, Apple said the money had been promised in conjunction with an agreement not to buy chips from other suppliers or to divulge Qualcomm\\u2019s intellectual property licensing practices. The suit seeks the rebates, among other things. Apple sued three days after the  Federal Trade Commission accused Qualcomm of using anticompetitive practices to guarantee its high royalty payments for advanced wireless technology. The commission cited Qualcomm\\u2019s deals with Taiwanese companies that manufacture Apple iPhones over semiconductors it sells for the iPhone. In its complaint, the commission described Qualcomm as \\u201cthe world\\u2019s dominant supplier\\u201d of semiconductors that manage smartphone communications. The commission said Qualcomm had obtained \\u201celevated royalties\\u201d for its patented intellectual property on wireless communications. Other smartphone chip makers have to pay Qualcomm for that intellectual property, too. The commission and Apple complaints follow several other problems, including a $975 million fine by Chinese regulators in 2015 and activist shareholder complaints later that year that forced layoffs at Qualcomm. Last month, Qualcomm was fined $850 million in South Korea for unfair patent licensing. When Apple provided information to South Korean regulators in that case, and sought competing chips from Intel, Qualcomm refused to pay Apple its promised money, Apple said. Qualcomm has vowed to fight the South Korean charge and the F. T. C. suit. \\u201cApple has intentionally mischaracterized our agreements and negotiations,\\u201d Qualcomm said in a statement, adding that it would fight that lawsuit, too. Few expect Qualcomm to back down. It was shaped by its founders to be brainy, combative and profitable. \\u201cThey are seasoned, and equipped to fight,\\u201d said Mark Hung, an analyst at Gartner. \\u201cBut when such a big company is so reliant on the way it sells its intellectual property, and under the microscope in various geographies, it\\u2019s tough. \\u201d Qualcomm, which is based in San Diego, far from Silicon Valley, was founded in 1985 by seven people, including Irwin Jacobs and Andrew Viterbi. The two were   electrical engineering professors who had formed a military satellite communications company. Qualcomm\\u2019s engineers work at a   campus between a park and the University of California, San Diego. They have earned thousands of patents, including for the airplane mode on smartphones and the way apps are downloaded from stores. Companies like Samsung and Apple need Qualcomm for the technology that enables things like   wireless video for millions of people at once. Its major technology is spread spectrum, which harnesses lots of computation and clever radio engineering for use in the various functions of smartphones. Qualcomm\\u2019s radio technology is called CDMA, for code division multiple access, a way voice calls work more efficiently over cellphone networks. And the company\\u2019s influence grew over the last several years with the advent of   or 3G, phones as people started downloading lots of mobile data as well as making calls. At the time, many thought Qualcomm\\u2019s success would be limited to that transition. Instead, Qualcomm innovated in 4G wireless for the new smartphones from Samsung and Apple that toppled Nokia and Motorola. In its last fiscal year, Qualcomm had revenue of $23. 6 billion and a profit of $5. 7 billion. Qualcomm\\u2019s ventures in phones and network gear helped promote CDMA but did not make much money because older companies did not need CDMA until the success of wireless began to tax the capacity of their networks. Qualcomm turned to Asian companies that wanted to get into wireless. \\u201cYou\\u2019d never have seen the Koreans or the Chinese in wireless if not for Qualcomm and CDMA,\\u201d said Clint McClellan, a   employee of Qualcomm who now runs a wireless health business. \\u201cWe enabled those markets. \\u201d South Korea, in particular, made CDMA an industrial policy, which carried Qualcomm for years. More recently, China accounted for half of Qualcomm\\u2019s revenue. Apple\\u2019s Taiwanese manufacturers, which pay Qualcomm royalties for iPhones, are another big profit center. Qualcomm would not say what it charges for its intellectual property, but analysts figure the fee usually amounts to 5 percent of the selling price of a phone  \\u2014   at least it did, until the 2015 Chinese fine, which included an agreement that Chinese manufacturers pay only about half the old Qualcomm royalty. That, and problems collecting Chinese royalties even before the agreement, hurt Qualcomm\\u2019s share price. In 2015, Jana Partners, an activist hedge fund, stepped in and pressed for a breakup of the company into separate intellectual property and chip businesses. That did not happen, but Qualcomm cut about 15 percent of its staff, cut executive pay and gave Jana three board seats. The stock has recovered to about where it was just before the fine, but not to the heights it reached before the problems. By helping to create today\\u2019s smartphone giants, Qualcomm may have engineered its current woes. Qualcomm executives say they see a connection between the China discounts, which Qualcomm had hoped would be limited to that country, and the latest regulatory attacks. \\u201cWe believe Samsung had a major role to play in the Korean decision,\\u201d said Don Rosenberg, a lawyer for Qualcomm. The regulators, he said, \\u201cwere prodded and misled by commercial interests. \\u201d In an email,   Jee, a spokeswoman for Samsung, said it \\u201cwas one of many multinational corporations\\u201d that responded to questions from South Korean regulators. Qualcomm\\u2019s lawyer figures the Korean case may take years to move through the courts. And recent events, including the impeachment of South Korea\\u2019s president and a  bribery scandal at Samsung, could complicate, or eliminate, Qualcomm\\u2019s regulatory issues there. Additionally, the F. T. C. has just three of its normal five commissioners. One of those, Maureen Ohlhausen, a Republican, voted against the suit. She may be named chairwoman when the current chairwoman, Edith Ramirez, a Democrat, steps down on Feb. 10. Neither the F. T. C. nor Apple would comment on the United States case against Qualcomm. \\u201cIt\\u2019s disappointing when our partners want to pay less after we\\u2019ve contributed to their success,\\u201d said Derek Aberle, Qualcomm\\u2019s president. Now it must get out ahead of other technology inventors in 5G, possibly while paying billions in fines and dealing with a painful restructuring and fraying relationships with its biggest customers. \\u201cWe\\u2019re not sitting still\\u201d while the problems are sorted, Mr. Aberle said. \\u201cYou have to invest, and invent cool stuff that will change the way people live their lives. \\u201d In other words, create unique technology so people will keep paying for Qualcomm\\u2019s expensive intellectual property.\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}",
